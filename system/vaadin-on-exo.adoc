= Deploying Vaadin portlets on eXo platform

[.author]
Jonatan Kronqvist, Sami Ekblad, and Leif Åstrand

[WARNING]
These instructions are based on previous versions of Vaadin Framework and eXo platform.
The same principle still applies, but the exact details might vary.

There are two things you need to do to deploy Vaadin portlets on eXo platform:

. Extract the [filename]#VAADIN# directory from the Vaadin JAR and place it in [filename]#bin/tomcat6-bundle/webapps/ROOT/html#.

** You will have to create the [filename]#html# subdirectory.

. Deploy your portlets in [filename]#bin/tomcat6-bundle/webapps#.

When the files are in place you can refresh the portlets from eXo's admin page after which the portlet(s) will be available to users.
